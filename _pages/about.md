## About Me

Hi, I’m **Zhedong Lin**, an MSc student in **Artificial Intelligence** at the **University of Auckland**. I received my undergraduate degree in **Computer Science and Technology** from **Southwest University** in 2024. I am currently working under the guidance of **Prof. Jiamou Liu**, and my research focuses on **LLMs**, **multimodal generative AI**, and applications such as **text-to-image systems**, **image editing**, and **controllable diffusion models**. If you are interested in my research or would like to discuss potential collaboration, feel free to contact me at **zlin629@aucklanduni.ac.nz**.

## Research Interests

My research focuses on exploring cutting-edge techniques in **multimodal generative AI**, particularly **text-to-image generation** and **image editing**. I am particularly interested in applying **large-scale foundation models** to create coherent and realistic outputs across different modalities.

- **Text-to-Image (T2I) Generation**: Focusing on improving the consistency and quality of AI-generated images from textual descriptions.
- **Multimodal Systems**: Exploring methods to effectively fuse data from various modalities to achieve enhanced generative capabilities.
- **Controllable Diffusion Models**: Developing models that allow fine-grained control over image generation processes, making them adaptable for various creative tasks.
- **AI-driven Image Editing**: Investigating the use of AI to edit images in a manner that retains contextual consistency and enhances user-driven creativity.

My work aims to advance the capabilities of AI in generating consistent, high-quality, and editable visual content, with applications in creative industries, research, and education.
